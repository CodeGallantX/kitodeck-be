```

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

1. Create feature branch from `develop`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-authentication-flow develop
   ```

2. Commit changes with semantic messages:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(auth): implement OAuth2 support"
   ```

3. Open pull request to `develop` branch

### Code Standards

* PEP 8 compliance
* Type hints for all new code
* Docstrings for public methods
* 100% test coverage for new features

## Deployment

### Render Setup

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Create new Web Service on [Render](https://render.com)
3. Connect your GitHub repo
4. Set environment variables in the Render dashboard
5. Select build and start commands:

   ```bash
   # Build Command
   pip install -r requirements.txt && python manage.py migrate

   # Start Command
   gunicorn core.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
   ```
6. Deploy and monitor logs via Render dashboard

## Performance Metrics

| Endpoint           | Avg Response | 99th %ile | Throughput |
| ------------------ | ------------ | --------- | ---------- |
| POST /auth/login/  | 120ms        | 250ms     | 1500 RPM   |
| GET /user/details/ | 80ms         | 150ms     | 2000 RPM   |
| POST /image-scan/  | 900ms        | 1.5s      | 800 RPM    |
| POST /chat-scan/   | 600ms        | 1.3s      | 580 RPM    |

Optimization techniques:

* Database indexing
* Query optimization
* Response caching
* Connection pooling

## Retrospective

### What Went Well

‚úÖ **Modular Design** enabled easy feature additions
‚úÖ **Performance** met all SLA requirements
‚úÖ **Documentation** reduced onboarding time

### Challenges

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Token Management Race Conditions

Initially, when a user's access token expired and multiple parallel requests were made, each one tried to refresh the token at the same time. This led to inconsistent behavior where some requests failed with 401 even though a new token had already been issued. I solved this by introducing a token refresh queue that ensured only one token refresh operation was active at any given time using a session-scoped mutex lock.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Email Deliverability Failures

Emails for password reset and verification were failing silently. After investigating SMTP settings and reviewing logs, I realized SSL on port 465 was misconfigured. Switching to TLS on port 587 and adding proper logging revealed underlying connection timeouts. I added a retry mechanism with exponential backoff and improved email error visibility.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Broken Redirect After Login

The login flow initially returned a successful 200 status along with a valid JWT token pair (access and refresh). However, users were immediately redirected back to `/auth/login`, effectively making it seem as though the authentication failed ‚Äî even though it hadn't. After deep-diving into the browser devtools and debugging both the authentication and routing logic, I identified the following critical issues:

1. **Token Persistence Race Condition**: While the backend correctly issued the tokens, they weren‚Äôt reliably persisted in `localStorage` before the dashboard‚Äôs session validation logic kicked in. This created a race condition where the frontend attempted to verify a session before the tokens were actually available, triggering an unauthorized response and redirect loop.

2. **Frontend Session Check Misalignment**: The dashboard fetch logic depended on immediate availability of a valid access token. There was no mechanism in place to wait for token readiness or to retry authentication gracefully if the initial check failed.


#### üõ†Ô∏è Fixes Implemented

* **Token Handling Synchronization**:
  * I refactored the login handler to synchronously persist tokens in `localStorage` before any routing or state updates occurred.
  * Added a `useEffect` hook on the dashboard page to verify token availability before firing secure data fetches.

* **Session Rehydration Layer**:
  * Implemented a `loading` gate that blocks access to protected pages until token verification completes.

* **Graceful Fallbacks**:
  * Integrated a redirect fallback to `/dashboard` if a previous route was unavailable, avoiding dead-end 404s.


#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Expired Database in Production

During a break in development to focus on exams, the hosted PostgreSQL database on Render expired due to inactivity. As a result, all API requests to the production server began failing silently, returning internal server errors without clear messaging.

Diagnosing the issue wasn't straightforward ‚Äî I had missed Render‚Äôs expiration notification email, and since development had paused, the root cause wasn‚Äôt immediately fresh in mind. When I resumed work and noticed repeated failures, I initially reverted the backend to use a local SQLite database on `127.0.0.1` to isolate and test the API logic.

Upon inspecting Render‚Äôs server logs more thoroughly, I discovered that the PostgreSQL instance had indeed expired and was no longer available for connections.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Fixes Implemented

1. **Isolated API Failures Locally**
   Reconfigured the backend to run locally using SQLite, which confirmed that the issue was specific to the production database, not the app logic.

2. **Log Inspection on Render**
   Accessed Render‚Äôs service logs and noticed connection errors tied to the missing PostgreSQL service.

3. **Provisioned a New Database**
   Created a new managed PostgreSQL instance via Render, updated environment variables (`DATABASE_URL`), and redeployed the backend.

4. **Restored Production Setup**
   Switched back to PostgreSQL, pointed the API to the correct deployment URL, and confirmed successful reconnection with persistence and migration checks.
